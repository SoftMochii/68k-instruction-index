#   68000 Disassembler Manual Index
##  Background
##### This project was created using React.js. It was created in hope to reduce the frustration  students get when they are learning assembly language, or at least, make their hardware class less painful. 

##  Usage
##### Users can quickly search through 68000 assembly language instruction [manual](https://www.nxp.com/files-static/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf) without going through all the filler words in the manual. It provides faster lookup on assembly instructions than using CTRL + F to search through couple hundreds other non relevant words.
##### Type in your desire instruction keywords (ex: ADD, MOVE...etc), the list will return page numbers that the instruction on the PDF manual.
