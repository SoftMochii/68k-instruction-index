#   68000 Instruction Manual Index

##  Demo
I am hosting this website on [HERE](https://68k.azurewebsites.net), using Azure Free Tier, so availability may be limited.

##  Background
This project was created using React.js. It was created in hope to reduce the frustration users get when they are learning assembly language.

Users can quickly search through 68000 assembly language instruction without going through all the filler words in the manual. It provides faster lookup on assembly instructions rather than using the search function (CTRL + F) to go through couple hundred other irrelevant words in the pdf document.

####  The 68000 manual PDF can be found [here](https://www.nxp.com/files-static/archives/doc/ref_manual/M68000PRM.pdf)

##  Usage
Type your instruction keywords (ex: ADD, MOVE...) in the search box, the list will return found/relevant information to help you navigate through the PDF manual.

Clicking on page number will reference you to the same page number in the PDF.

##  Installing
You need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.

After cloning the repo, you will need to run below command to install all the packages.

```npm install```

Then you can start your development server by typing below command.

```npm start```
